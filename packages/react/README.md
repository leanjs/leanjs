# @leanjs/react

## Installation

If your React app is in a monorepo (recommended) execute the following command at the root of your repository:

```sh
yarn add -W @leanjs/react @leanjs/core
```

then in the `package.json` of your React app add the following `peerDependencies`:

```
"peerDependencies": {
  "@leanjs/core": "*",
  "@leanjs/react": "*"
}
```

If your React app is not in a monorepo, then run the following command instead of the above:

```sh
yarn add @leanjs/react @leanjs/core
```

## Basic usage

### `createRuntimeBindings`

First, you have to create your React bindings (**HostProvider**, **useGetter**, etc) for your [`runtime`](../core/README.md#the-leanjs-runtime).

```ts
// shared-runtime.ts

// You need to configure your runtime
const defaultState = { locale: "en" }; // this is just an example
export const { createRuntime } = configureRuntime(defaultState)({
  onError: () => {},
});

// Then create your React bindings for your runtime
export const {
  HostProvider,
  useGetter,
  useSetter,
  useLoading,
  useError,
  useRuntime,
} = createRuntimeBindings(createRuntime);
```

:::info

Read [@leanjs/core](../core/README.md#basic-usage) if you have not already created your own `createRuntime` function

:::

Add your `HostProvider` at the root of your React component tree, e.g.

```tsx
// It's recommended to move your ./shared-runtime file to its own package
import { createRuntime, HostProvider } from "./shared-runtime";

const runtime = createRuntime({ context: { appName: "AppExample" } });

export function App({ children }) {
  return <HostProvider runtime={runtime}>{children}</HostProvider>;
}
```

Use any of your hooks in your components, e.g.

```tsx
// It's recommended to move your ./shared-runtime file to its own package
import { useGetter } from "./shared-runtime";

export function LocaleComponent() {
  const locale = useGetter("locale");

  return <p>Current locale is {locale}</p>;
}
```

## Composable app

Create small React apps that can be composed with other apps.

### `createApp`

Arguments:

- `App: ReactElement` - required
- `options: { appName?: string }` - optional. By default, the name of your composable app is the name of your `App` component. You can change it using the optional argument `appName`.

Create a file called `index.ts|js` in the `src` directory where your composable app is. For example:

```
my-monorepo/
â”œâ”€ apps/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ react-host/
â”œâ”€ composable-apps/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ react-app-1/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ package.json
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ src/
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ ReactApp1.tsx
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.ts ðŸ‘ˆ
â”œâ”€ package.json
```

:::tip

Read the recommended setup in our [getting started page](../../docs/getting-started/#recommended-setup) if you want to create a similar monorepo structure

:::

Call `createApp` with the root component of your app, for example:

```ts
// my-monorepo/composable-apps/react-app-1/src/index.ts

import { createApp } from "@leanjs/react";

import { ReactApp1 } from "./ReactApp1";

// ðŸ‘‡ you have to `export default`
export default createApp(ReactApp1);

// The name of the composable app is the name of your component,
// "ReactApp1 in this case.
// you can name it differently using the second argument, e.g.
// export default createApp(ReactApp1, { appName: "SomeName" });
```

Hello world example of the `ReactApp1` imported above

```tsx
// my-monorepo/composable-apps/react-app-1/src/ReactApp1.tsx

import React from "react";

export const ReactApp1 = () => <h1>Hello React composable app 1</h1>;
```

Create a file called `selfHosted.ts|js` in the `src` directory where your composable app is, for example:

```
my-monorepo/
â”œâ”€ apps/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ react-host/
â”œâ”€ composable-apps/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ react-app-1/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ package.json
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ src/
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ ReactApp1.tsx
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.ts
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ selfHosted.ts ðŸ‘ˆ
â”œâ”€ package.json
```

Export a `createRuntime` function from the `selfHosted.ts|js` file. This is the runtime that will be used when the app runs in isolation, meaning without a host.

```ts
// my-monorepo/composable-apps/react-app-1/src/selfHosted.ts

export { createRuntime } from "@my-org/runtime-react";
```

:::info

Read [@leanjs/core](../core/README.md#basic-usage) if you have not already created your own `createRuntime` function

:::

## Components

### `HostProvider`

You have to **call [createRuntimeBindings](#createruntimebindings) to create a `HostProvider` component** before you use it. `HostProvider` stores in a React context values that are shared across apps hosted in the same component tree. Props:

#### `runtime` prop - required

Your Lean [runtime](../core/README.md).

#### `origin` prop - optional

[Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) where your remote composable apps are. During development, use the address where you run your Lean [proxy dev server](../cli/README.md#proxy-dev-server). Use the address of your CDN in production, e.g. `https://cdn.example.com`.

Example

```tsx
// where does shared-runtime come from? Read the "Usage" section at the top
import { createRuntime, HostProvider } from "./shared-runtime";

const runtime = createRuntime({ context: { appName: "AppExample" } });
// origin is optional, it's only used if micro-frontends are enabled
const origin = process.env.MICROFRONTENDS_ORIGIN;

export function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <HostProvider runtime={runtime} origin={origin}>
      {children}
    </HostProvider>
  );
}
```

### ErrorBoundary

It catches both rendering errors and errors from Suspense.

#### `children` - required prop

React nodes displayed if there are no errors.

#### `fallback` - optional prop

Error fallback component displayed when an error is caught by the `ErrorBoundary`.

```ts
type ErrorFallbackComponent = (props: {
  error: AppError;
}) => React.ReactElement;

interface AppError extends Error {
  appName?: string;
  version?: string;
}
```

#### `onError` - optional prop

Function called when an error is caught.

```ts
onError?: (error: AppError, options?: LogErrorOptions) => void;

interface LogErrorOptions {
    appName?: string;
    version?: string;
}

interface AppError extends Error, LogErrorOptions {}
```

If `onError` is not provided and an error is caught by the `ErrorBoundary` the error will be logged using the [`onError`](../core/README.md#onerror---required-function) function passed to the `configureRuntime` if a `HostProvider` is found in the component tree.

### `Host`

It hosts a composable app in a React host.

#### `app` - required prop

The `app` prop expects a `GetComposableApp` type. You can `import` a `GetComposableApp` from any `export default createApp()` function, for instance:

```tsx
// my-monorepo/composable-apps/react-app-1/src/index.tsx

import { createApp } from "@leanjs/react";
import { ReactApp1 } from "./ReactApp1";

export default createApp(ReactApp1);
```

then pass it to the `Host` component in a React app:

```tsx
// my-monorepo/apps/react-host/src/index.ts

import React from "react";
import { Host } from "@leanjs/react";

// this composable app is bundled and deployed along with the host app
import ReactApp1 from "@my-org/react-app-1";

const Home = () => (
  <>
    <h1>React Host</h1>
    <Host app={ReactApp1} />
  </>
);

export default Home;
```

:::info

In this example, both the host app and the composable app are React apps. However, the React `<Host>` component can host any composable app, e.g. Vue.

:::

You can also pass a function to the `Host` component that returns a dynamic import to lazy load a composable app:

```tsx
// my-monorepo/apps/react-host/src/index.ts

import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Host, ErrorBoundary } from "@leanjs/react";

const Home = () => (
  <>
    <h1>React Host</h1>
    {/* The network can fail.
     Add an ErrorBoundary if you are hosting an app using a dynamic import */}
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        <Host
          app={() => {
            // this composable app is bundled in a separate chunk
            // but it's still built and deployed along with the host app
            return import("@my-org/react-app-1");
          }}
        />
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  </>
);

export default Home;
```

Alternatively, you can pass an object to the `app` prop with a `packageName` key which value is the field `name` in the package.json of the composable app that you want to host. In this case, the `Host` component will try to fetch the `mount` function from the remote `origin` specified in `<HostProvider origin=" ðŸ‘‰ HERE ðŸ‘ˆ " runtime={runtime}>` (see [origin prop](#origin-prop---optional) to know more). For example:

```tsx
// my-monorepo/apps/react-host/src/index.ts

import { Host, ErrorBoundary } from "@leanjs/react";

const Home = () => (
  <>
    <h1>React Host</h1>
    {/* The network can fail.
     Add an ErrorBoundary if you are hosting a remote app */}
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        {/* in this case, the composable app is neither built nor deployed
          along with the React host */}
        <Host app={{ packageName: "@my-org/react-app-1" }} />
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  </>
);

export default Home;
```

:::caution
Fetching from a remote `origin` only works with Webpack v5 because this feature uses Module Federation under the hood. You need to add a [HostWebpackPlugin](../webpack/README.md#hostwebpackplugin) to your Webpack configuration to enable this feature. If this feature is enabled you need to build and deploy your composable apps independently. See [@leanjs/aws](../aws/README.md) to deploy your composable apps to AWS.
:::

:::tip
You can still pass an `import` (either dynamic or static) to the `app` prop of the `Host` component and configure Webpack to fetch it from a remote origin by changing the configuration of your `HostWebpackPlugin`.
:::

Tip example:

```tsx
// webpack.config.js of the host application
const { HostWebpackPlugin } = require("@leanjs/webpack");

module.exports = {
  // the rest of your configuration goes here
  plugins: [
    new HostWebpackPlugin({
      remotes: {
        // these packages are not built along with the host app
        // but downloaded from a remote origin
        packages: ["@my-org/react-app-1"],
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

then in your React app:

```tsx
// my-monorepo/apps/react-host/src/index.ts

import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Host, ErrorBoundary } from "@leanjs/react";

// this composable app is neither bundled nor deployed along with the host app
// because of the above remote: { packages: ["@my-org/react-app-1"] }
// in the webpack.config.js HostWebpackPlugin
import ReactApp1 from "@my-org/react-app-1";

const Home = () => (
  <>
    <h1>React Host</h1>
    {/* The network can fail.
     Add an ErrorBoundary if you are hosting a remote app */}
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        <Host app={ReactApp1} />
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  </>
);

export default Home;
```

**Pro-tip**
Configure your `remotes` in `HostWebpackPlugin` on development only. This way no CI/CD changes are required. It also reduces build time of your monolith in development since these packages are excluded from the monolith build. Last but not least, you can experiment with micro-frontends in development without changing how you implement and host your apps.

Pro-tip example:

```tsx
// webpack.config.js of the host application
const { HostWebpackPlugin } = require("@leanjs/webpack");

module.exports = {
  // the rest of your configuration goes here
  plugins: [
    new HostWebpackPlugin({
      remotes: {
        // the following packages are built and deployed along with
        // the React app on production, but not during development.
        packages:
          process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? [] : ["@my-org/react-app-1"],
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

#### `className` - optional prop

CSS class added to the root DOM element where the [`app` prop](#app---required-prop) is mounted.

```tsx
// my-monorepo/apps/react-host/src/index.ts

import React from "react";
import { Host } from "@leanjs/react";
import ReactApp1 from "@my-org/react-app-1";

const Home = () => (
  <>
    <h1>React Host</h1>
    <Host className="some-css-class" app={ReactApp1} />
  </>
);

export default Home;
```

## Hooks

### `useGetter`

Hook to get the current state of a given state property. You have to **call [createRuntimeBindings](#createruntimebindings) to create a `useGetter` hook** before you use it.

Arguments:

1. State property, required.
2. Loader function, optional.

The output is the current state of the given property.

Example:

```tsx
// where does shared-runtime come from? Read the "Usage" section at the top
import { useGetter } from "./shared-runtime";

export function LocaleComponent() {
  const locale = useGetter("locale", () =>
    fetch("/api/settings")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => data.locale)
  );

  return <p>Locale is {locale}</p>;
}
```

### `useSetter`

Hook to update the value of a given state property. You have to **call [createRuntimeBindings](#createruntimebindings) to create a `useSetter` hook** before you use it.

Arguments:

1. State property, required.

The output is a function to update the value of the given state property.

Example:

```jsx
// where does shared-runtime come from? Read the "Usage" section at the top
import { useSetter } from "./shared-runtime";

export function ThemeSelector() {
  const setTheme = useSetter("theme");

  return (
    <>
      <label for="theme-select">Choose a theme:</label>
      <select
        onChange={(e) => setTheme(e.target.value)}
        name="theme"
        id="theme-select"
      >
        <option value="">--Please choose an option--</option>
        <option value="dark">Dark</option>
        <option value="light">Light</option>
      </select>
    </>
  );
}
```

### `useLoading`

Hook to get the loading state of a given state property. You have to **call [createRuntimeBindings](#createruntimebindings) to create a `useLoading` hook** before you use it.

Arguments:

1. State property, required.

The output is a boolean indicating if the given state property is loading.

Example:

```tsx
// where does shared-runtime come from? Read the "Usage" section at the top
import { useLoading } from "./shared-runtime";

export function LocaleSpinner() {
  const loading = useLoading("locale");

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```

### `useError`

Hook to get the error state if a given state property failed to load. You have to **call [createRuntimeBindings](#createruntimebindings) to create a `useError` hook** before you use it.

Arguments:

1. State property, required.

The output is undefined or a string with the error message.

Example:

```tsx
// where does shared-runtime come from? Read the "Usage" section at the top
import { useError } from "./shared-runtime";

export function LocaleErrorMessage() {
  const error = useError("locale");

  if (error) {
    return <p>Oops, locale error: {error} </p>;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```

### `useRuntime`

It returns the shared `runtime` from the context. You have to **call [createRuntimeBindings](#createruntimebindings) to create a `useRuntime` hook** before you use it.

Example:

```jsx
// where does shared-runtime come from? Read the "Usage" section at the top
import { useRuntime } from "./shared-runtime";

// HostProvider must be an ancestor of the following component
export function Component() {
  const runtime = useRuntime(); // do something with runtime

  return <h1>My component</h1>;
}
```
